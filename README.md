# BlauSQL: a menu-oriented TEXT mode JDBC database client

BlauSQL is a lightweight, TEXT mode, universal JDBC database client, 
with an easy to use menu-oriented user interface.

It can run in the terminal of every Unix-like system, where Java is installed and can connect to 
any database which has a JDBC driver. Ideal if you need to run a couple of quick queries
in an SSH session, but prefer menu-oriented user interfaces.

JDBC connection details can be saved, so connecting to your database requires only two keystrokes,
to select the database to connect to from the menu, after which you can immediately start 
writing your query.
